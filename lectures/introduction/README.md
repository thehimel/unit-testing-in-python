# Introduction

## Python unit testing with pytest

![img.png](introduction.png)

- As a developer, you're constantly prioritizing what you should focus on and figuring out how today's work fits into
those long-term goals.
- When building and testing Python projects from scratch, you may lose sight of this goal as you try to implement too
many features at once.
- When maintaining a Legacy project, you may feel overwhelmed as you find it has too few or no tests.
- Believe it or not, test-driven development may be just what you need to organize the path ahead of you.
- We'll explore that in this course in concert with pytest, a testing framework.
- I'm Jasmine Omeke, and I'm a software developer working on a big data and analytics platform.
- I've also contributed to open source projects such as gRPC, Apache Airflow, and pytest.
- I have learned a lot about prioritization, and I want to talk about that through the lens of pytest.
- We will focus on pytest and its capabilities. Paired with test-driven development, pytest will help you become more
productive as you pragmatically write modular tests.
- To help you continue practicing your newfound pytest knowledge, I will recommend potential sample projects as we make
our way through the course.
- I'm excited to have you join me, and please let me know what feedback you have.
